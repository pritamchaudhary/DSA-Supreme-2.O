Learning DSA from Love Babbar

DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms. It's a fundamental concept in computer science that focuses on: 
->Organizing and storing data efficiently
->Designing algorithms to solve computational problems
->Creating machine-efficient and optimized computer programs

DSA is applied in problem-solving and enables developers to learn to write efficient code. The quality of the code can be judged by how much memory and time it consumes.
